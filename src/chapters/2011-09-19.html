<h1>basic IO methods</h1>
<p>(Consider C library functions (3) analogues while the system call (2)
 functions are inevitably called by Ruby)</p>

<h2>Opening (and Closing) Files</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>File.open - fopen(3) which wraps open(2) and provides a File object</p></li>
<li><p>IO#close - fclose(3), close(2)
         Copies Ruby buffers to the kernel, invalidates the IO object
         and releases the file descriptor so it may be reused by the
         kernel.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These methods will be covered in more detail as we dig deeper.</p>

<h2>Some File Operations for Reading and Writing</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>IO#read - fread(3) - read all specified bytes</p></li>
<li><p>IO#write - fwrite(3) - write all specified bytes</p></li>
<li><p>IO#sync, IO#sync= - setvbuf(3) - controls Ruby (write) buffering</p></li>
<li><p>IO#flush - fflush(3) - copies existing Ruby (write) buffers to kernel</p></li>
<li><p>IO#syswrite - write(2) - copies application buffers to kernel</p></li>
<li><p>IO#sysread - read(2) - copies kernel buffers to application</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(there are more methods which we'll cover in time, of course)</p>

<p>Setting IO#sync= to true will make IO#write copy application buffers
directly into kernel buffers, bypassing Ruby buffers.  IO#sync does not
influence read buffering.</p>

<p>If IO#sync is false, IO#write may copy small application buffers into
Ruby buffers to before internally doing IO#flush.</p>

<p>The non-sys* methods will retry until the operation is complete (or
raise on any errors).  The sys* variants do not retry if the kernel
returns a partial read(2) or write(2) and will also raise on errors.</p>

<p>Mixing sys* and non-sys* methods is not recommended and will result in
errors or exceptions.</p>

<p>If you need more detailed descriptions, check `ri' or other Ruby
doc for Ruby methods.  For C library functions and system calls, your
Unix-like OS should provide manpages and you can search online, too.
I have no intention of regurgitating API documentation.</p>
